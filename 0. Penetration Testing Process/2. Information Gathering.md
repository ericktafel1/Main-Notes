* All the steps we take to exploit the vulnerabilities are based on the information we enumerate about our targets. This phase can be considered the cornerstone of any penetration test. We can obtain the necessary information relevant to us in many different ways. However, we can divide them into the following categories:
	- ### **Open-Source Intelligence**
		- OSINT involves extracting security-relevant details, including sensitive information like passwords and keys, often accessible due to misconfigurations on platforms such as Github. The process requires careful handling of critical security vulnerabilities, and findings may include publicly shared SSH keys and code sections on platforms like StackOverflow, emphasizing the need to address and close potential security holes.
	- ### **Infrastructure Enumeration**
		- A combination of OSINT and active scans is employed to understand the company's internet and intranet positions. Utilizing services like DNS, a detailed map of servers, hosts, and infrastructure components is created, allowing for precise identification of hosts and their security measures. Includes assessing firewalls and security measures to refine attack strategies, considering factors such as evasive testing and potential alarms. 
	- ### **Service Enumeration**
		- The focus is on identifying and understanding network-accessible services on a host or server, including details such as version history, information provided, and potential use cases. Evaluating the version history is crucial for uncovering security vulnerabilities, but administrators may hesitate to update applications to avoid potential disruptions, leading to a trade-off between maintaining functionality and addressing security gaps.
	- ### **Host Enumeration**
		- Examine each host, employing active scans and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) methods to identify operating systems, services, and vulnerabilities. Whether performed externally or internally, the enumeration process reveals potentially unsupported and vulnerable services, including those assumed secure within internal networks, often leading to the discovery of misconfigurations and lax security practices. Internal host enumeration, typically conducted after successful exploitation, involves scrutinizing sensitive files, local services, and other elements to assess potential vulnerabilities and exploit opportunities during the Post-Exploitation phase.

### Pillaging

* After hitting the `Post-Exploitation` stage, pillaging is performed to collect sensitive information locally on the already exploited host, such as employee names, customer data, and much more. However, this information gathering only occurs after exploiting the target host and gaining access to it.
* The information we can obtain on the exploited hosts can be divided into many different categories and varies greatly. This depends on the purpose of the host and its positioning in the corporate network. The administrators taking the security measures for these hosts also play a significant role. Nevertheless, such information can show the `impact` of a potential attack on our client and be used for further steps to `escalate our privileges` or `move laterally` further in the network.
* Pillaging alone is not a stage or a subcategory as many often describe but an integral part of the information gathering and privilege escalation stages that is inevitably performed locally on target systems.
