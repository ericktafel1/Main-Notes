* `Proof of Concept` (`PoC`) or `Proof of Principle` is a project management term. In project management, it serves as proof that a project is feasible in principle. The criteria for this can lie in technical or business factors. Therefore, it is the basis for further work, in our case, the necessary steps to secure the corporate network by confirming the discovered vulnerabilities.
* In other words, it serves as a decision-making basis for the further course of action. At the same time, it enables risks to be identified and minimized.
* One of the most common examples used to prove software vulnerabilities is executing the calculator (calc.exe on Windows) on the target system. In principle, the PoC also assesses the probability of success of system access from actual exploitation.
