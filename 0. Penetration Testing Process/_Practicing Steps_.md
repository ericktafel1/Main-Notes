* Think about the skills you have gained and what interests you the most from them. From there, we can pick out a few more modules to increase our knowledge, machines to practice on, and Prolabs or Endgames to really put ourselves to the test. The numbers below are a good starting example:
	* 2x Modules
	- 3x Retired Machines
	- 5x Active Machines
	- 1x Pro Lab / Endgame

### Modules

* The modules chosen should be categorized according to `two different difficulties`: `technical` and `offensive`.
* Create efficient `notes` and `screenshots` for accurate `documentation`. Here is a good blueprint for tackling a module:

|**Step**|**Task**|
|---|---|
|1.|Read the module|
|2.|Practice the exercises|
|3.|Complete the module|
|4.|Start the module exercises from scratch|
|5.|While solving the exercises again, take notes|
|6.|Create technical documentation based on the notes|
|7.|Create non-technical documentation based on the notes|

---
### Retired Machines

* When we have completed (at least) two modules and are satisfied with our notes and documentation, we can select three different retired machines. These should also differ in difficulty, but we recommend choosing `two easy` and `one medium` machines.
* At the end of each module, you will find recommended retired machines to consider that will help you practice the specific tools and topics covered in the module. These hosts will share one or more attack vectors tied to the module.
*  The order in which we can proceed to practice with the retired machines looks something like this:

|**Step**|**Task**|
|---|---|
|1.|Get the user flag on your own|
|2.|Get the root flag on your own|
|3.|Write your technical documentation|
|4.|Write your non-technical documentation|
|5.|Compare your notes with the official write-up (or a community write-up if you don't have a VIP subscription|
|6.|Create a list of information you have missed|
|7.|Watch [Ippsec's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6eh7gCkpPo5XXUDfygQQA) walkthrough and compare it with your notes|
|8.|Expand your notes and documentation by adding the missed parts|

* Finally, we should create `technical` and `non-technical` documentation again.

### Active Machines

* After building a good foundation with the modules and the retired machines, we can venture to `two easy`, `two medium`, and `one hard` active machine.
* We can also take these from the corresponding module recommendations at the end of each module in Academy.
* Ideal practice steps for active machines would look like this:

|**Step**|**Task**|
|---|---|
|1.|Get the user and root flag|
|2.|Write your technical documentation|
|3.|Write your non-technical documentation|
|4.|Have it proofread by technical and non-technical persons|

### Pro Lab/Endgame

* Once we feel comfortable going against singular hosts and documenting our findings, we can take on Prolabs and Endgames. These labs are large multi-host environments that often simulate enterprise networks of varying sizes similar to those we could run into during actual penetration tests for our clients.
* Attacking infrastructure with several interconnected hosts and network components will create additional connections we need to consider in our documentation. Instead of showing how to complete a single host from start to finish, we will need to practice writing up an entire attack chain, showing our path from foothold to network compromise.
