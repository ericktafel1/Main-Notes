* The [Hack The Box Forum](https://forum.hackthebox.eu/) is an excellent place for discussing live and retired `Hack The Box` boxes and challenges.
* Another great place to discuss `Hack The Box` boxes and challenges, in addition to various other aspects of `Hack The Box`, is the official `HTB` Discord server. We can join the Official `HTB` Discord server by clicking on this [link](https://discord.gg/hRXnCFA). We will be asked to download the Discord app and create our Discord account to access the `HTB` server.
* Be sure to include the following in our question:
	1. What point of the box/challenge are we stuck at 'i.e., user/root'?
	2. What steps have we taken so far to get to the point we are at?
	3. What step are we failing at, and what have we done to resolve our issue?
	4. Always try to be very specific on what we need help on, rather than asking for general help
* In case we are facing any technical issues, we can always search for the problem we are facing in the official [HTB FAQ](https://help.hackthebox.com/), which contains a lot of very detailed and helpful articles. We are very likely to find an answer to our question there. If we cannot find an answer to our question, feel free to raise a [ticket](https://help.hackthebox.com/en/) with HTB Support.
