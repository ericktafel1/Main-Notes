* Having completed one easy box as part of this module, we should be ready to start laying out more ambitious goals.

1. Complete Starting Point boxes
2. Choose a retired box rated `Easy` and root the box by following the provided writeup included with the VIP membership needed to access retired boxes.
3. Once we root one or several `Easy` boxes, try to up the level by completing a `Medium` box, which will probably require additional knowledge that is usually not required for `Easy` boxes.
4. Once we have completed 5-10 `Easy`/`Medium` retired boxes, you should be able to complete your first Live `Easy` box without following a full walkthrough. Try to pick a Live `Easy` Box with difficulty ratings at level 1-3 out of 10. If we get stuck, we can always get help from the channels previously discussed.
5. Once we finish Our first live box, try to complete other live boxes and other `Medium`/`Hard` live boxes.
