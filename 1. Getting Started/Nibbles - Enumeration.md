* Our first step when approaching any machine is to perform some basic enumeration.
* First, let us start with what we do know about the target. We already know the target's IP address, that it is Linux, and has a web-related attack vector.
* We call this a grey-box approach because we have some information about the target. 
* There are three main types, `black-box`, `grey-box`, and `white-box`, and each differs in the goal and approach.

|**Engagement**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Black-Box`|Low level to no knowledge of a target. The penetration tester must perform in-depth reconnaissance to learn about the target. This may be an external penetration test where the tester is given only the company name and no further information such as target IP addresses, or an internal penetration test where the tester either has to bypass controls to gain initial access to the network or can connect to the internal network but has no information about internal networks/hosts. This type of penetration test most simulates an actual attack but is not as comprehensive as other assessment types and could leave misconfigurations/vulnerabilities undiscovered.|
|`Grey-Box`|In a grey-box test, the tester is given a certain amount of information in advance. This may be a list of in-scope IP addresses/ranges, low-level credentials to a web application or Active Directory, or some application/network diagrams. This type of penetration test can simulate a malicious insider or see what an attacker can do with a low level of access. In this scenario, the tester will typically spend less time on reconnaissance and more time looking for misconfigurations and attempting exploitation.|
|`White-Box`|In this type of test, the tester is given complete access. In a web application test, they may be provided with administrator-level credentials, access to the source code, build diagrams, etc., to look for logic vulnerabilities and other difficult-to-discover flaws. In a network test, they may be given administrator-level credentials to dig into Active Directory or other systems for misconfigurations that may otherwise be missed. This assessment type is highly comprehensive as the tester will have access to both sides of a target and perform a comprehensive analysis.|
```shell-session
6165@htb[/htb]$ nmap -sV --open -oA nibbles_initial_scan 10.129.42.190
```
* Let us begin with a quick `nmap` scan to look for open ports using the command `nmap -sV --open -oA nibbles_initial_scan <ip address>`.
	* This will run a service enumeration (`-sV`) scan against the default top 1,000 ports and only return open ports (`--open`).
	* We can check which ports `nmap` scans for a given scan type by running a scan with no target specified, using the command `nmap -v -oG -`. Here we will output the greppable format to stdout with `-oG -` and `-v` for verbose output. Since no target is specified, the scan will fail but will show the ports scanned.
	* Output all scan formats using `-oA`
* Before we start poking around at the open ports, we can run a full TCP port scan using the command `nmap -p- --open -oA nibbles_full_tcp_scan 10.129.42.190`. 
	* This will check for any services running on non-standard ports that our initial can may have missed. Since this scans all 65,535 TCP ports, it can take a long time to finish depending on the network. We can leave this running in the background and move on with our enumeration.
* Using `nc` to do some banner grabbing confirms what `nmap` told us; the target is running an Apache web server and an OpenSSH server.
```shell-session
6165@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 10.129.42.190 22

(UNKNOWN) [10.129.42.190] 22 (ssh) open
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.2p2 Ubuntu-4ubuntu2.8
```
* `nc` tells us that port 80 runs an HTTP (web) server but does not show the banner.
```shell-session
6165@htb[/htb]$ nc -nv 10.129.42.190 80

(UNKNOWN) [10.129.42.190] 80 (http) open
```
* Let's do perform an `nmap` [script](https://nmap.org/book/man-nse.html) scan using the `-sC` flag. This flag uses the default scripts, which are listed [here](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/categories/default.html). These scripts can be intrusive, so it is always important to understand exactly how our tools work. We run the command `nmap -sC -p 22,80 -oA nibbles_script_scan 10.129.42.190`. Since we already know which ports are open, we can save time and limit unnecessary scanner traffic by specifying the target ports with `-p`.
```shell-session
6165@htb[/htb]$ nmap -sC -p 22,80 -oA nibbles_script_scan 10.129.42.190

* The script scan did not give us anything handy. Let us round out our `nmap` enumeration using the [http-enum script](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-enum.html), which can be used to enumerate common web application directories. This scan also did not uncover anything useful.
