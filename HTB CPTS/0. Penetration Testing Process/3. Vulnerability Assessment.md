* The vulnerability assessment phase is an analytical process based on the findings. There are four different types of analysis:

|**Analysis Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Descriptive`|Descriptive analysis is essential in any data analysis. On the one hand, it describes a data set based on individual characteristics. It helps to detect possible errors in data collection or outliers in the data set.|
|`Diagnostic`|Diagnostic analysis clarifies conditions' causes, effects, and interactions. Doing so provides insights that are obtained through correlations and interpretation. We must take a backward-looking view, similar to descriptive analysis, with the subtle difference that we try to find reasons for events and developments.|
|`Predictive`|By evaluating historical and current data, predictive analysis creates a predictive model for future probabilities. Based on the results of descriptive and diagnostic analyses, this method of data analysis makes it possible to identify trends, detect deviations from expected values at an early stage, and predict future occurrences as accurately as possible.|
|`Prescriptive`|Prescriptive analytics aims to narrow down what actions to take to eliminate or prevent a future problem or trigger a specific activity or process.|

### Vulnerability Research and Analysis

* `Information Gathering` and `Vulnerability Research` can be considered a part of descriptive analysis. This is where we identify the individual network or system components we are investigating. In `Vulnerability Research`, we look for known vulnerabilities, exploits, and security holes that have already been discovered and reported.
* We can find vulnerability disclosures for each component using many different sources. These include, but are not limited to:
	*  [CVEdetails](https://www.cvedetails.com/)
	* [Exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
	* [Vulners](https://vulners.com/)
	* [Packet Storm Security](https://packetstormsecurity.com/)
	* [NIST](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search?execution=e2s1)
* This is where `Diagnostic Analysis` and `Predictive Analysis` is used. Once we have found a published vulnerability like this, we can diagnose it to determine what is causing or has caused the vulnerability.

### Assessment of Possible Attack Vectors

* `Vulnerability Assessment` also includes the actual testing, which is part of `Predictive Analysis`. In doing so, we analyze historical information and combine it with the current information that we have been able to find out.

---
### The Return

* Suppose we are unable to detect or identify potential vulnerabilities from our analysis. In that case, we will return to the `Information Gathering` stage and look for more in-depth information than we have gathered so far. It is important to note that these two stages (`Information Gathering` and `Vulnerability Assessment`) often overlap, resulting in regular back and forth movement between them.
