* During the `Exploitation` stage, we look for ways that these weaknesses can be adapted to our use case to obtain the desired role (i.e., a foothold, escalated privileges, etc.). If we want to get a reverse shell, we need to modify the PoC to execute the code, so the target system connects back to us over (ideally) an encrypted connection to an IP address we specify. Therefore, the preparation of an exploit is mainly part of the `Exploitation` stage.

### Prioritization of Possible Attacks

* Once we have found one or two vulnerabilities during the `Vulnerability Assessment` stage that we can apply to our target network/system, we can prioritize those attacks. Which of those attacks we prioritize higher than the others depends on the following factors:
	- Probability of Success
	- Complexity
	- Probability of Damage
- In addition, we can assign these factors to a personal point system which will allow the evaluation to be more accurately calculated based on our skills and knowledge:

| **Factor** | **Points** | **Remote File Inclusion** | **Buffer Overflow** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1. Probability of Success | `10` | 10 | 8 |
| 2. Complexity - Easy | `5` | 4 | 0 |
| 3. Complexity - Medium | `3` | 0 | 3 |
| 4. Complexity - Hard | `1` | 0 | 0 |
| 5. Probability of Damage | `-5` | 0 | -5 |
| **Summary** | `max. 15` | 14 | 6 |

* Based on the above example, we would prefer the `remote file inclusion` attack. It is easy to prepare and execute and should not cause any damage if approached carefully.

### Preparation for the Attack

* Communication with the client is vital before proceeding with exploitation during penetration tests. Successful exploitation leads to post-exploitation stages with detailed note-taking and logging for reporting.
