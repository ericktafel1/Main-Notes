### Risk Management Process

* Data protection must focus on efficient yet effective policy implementation without negatively affecting an organization's business operations and productivity. To achieve this, organizations must follow a process called the `risk management process`. This process involves the following five steps:

|Step|Explanation|
|---|---|
|`Identifying the Risk`|Identifying risks the business is exposed to, such as legal, environmental, market, regulatory, and other types of risks.|
|`Analyze the Risk`|Analyzing the risks to determine their impact and probability. The risks should be mapped to the organization's various policies, procedures, and business processes.|
|`Evaluate the Risk`|Evaluating, ranking, and prioritizing risks. Then, the organization must decide to accept (unavoidable), avoid (change plans), control (mitigate), or transfer risk (insure).|
|`Dealing with Risk`|Eliminating or containing the risks as best as possible. This is handled by interfacing directly with the stakeholders for the system or process that the risk is associated with.|
|`Monitoring Risk`|All risks must be constantly monitored. Risks should be constantly monitored for any situational changes that could change their impact score, `i.e., from low to medium or high impact`.|

### Red Team vs. Blue Team

* Red teamers usually play an adversary role in breaking into the organization to identify any potential weaknesses real attackers may utilize to break the organization's defenses. The most common task on the red teaming side is penetration testing, social engineering, and other similar offensive techniques.
* On the other hand, the blue team makes up the majority of infosec jobs. It is responsible for strengthening the organization's defenses by analyzing the risks, coming up with policies, responding to threats and incidents, and effectively using security tools and other similar tasks.
