### These are my notes from online courses, helpful documentation I have found or created, and CTF Box writeups I have completed.
- The notes are typed in md on my local Obsidian app and pushed from my desktop using git to here... Some formatting may be off because of Obsidian plugins applied.
- - Hope this helps anyone but this is mainly for remote access to my notes... and data redundancy!
