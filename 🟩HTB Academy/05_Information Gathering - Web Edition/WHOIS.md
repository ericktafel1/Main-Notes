#WHOIS

___

We can consider [WHOIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS) as the "white pages" for domain names. It is a TCP-based transaction-oriented query/response protocol listening on TCP port 43 by default. We can use it for querying databases containing domain names, IP addresses, or autonomous systems and provide information services to Internet users. The protocol is defined in [RFC 3912](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3912). The first WHOIS directory was created in the early 1970s by [Elizabeth Feinler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_J._Feinler) and her team working out of Stanford University's Network Information Center (NIC). Together with her team, they created domains divided into categories based upon a computer's physical address. We can read more about the fascinating history of WHOIS [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS#History).

The WHOIS domain lookups allow us to retrieve information about the domain name of an already registered domain. The [Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers](https://www.icann.org/get-started) (`ICANN`) requires that accredited registrars enter the holder's contact information, the domain's creation, and expiration dates, and other information in the Whois database immediately after registering a domain. In simple terms, the Whois database is a searchable list of all domains currently registered worldwide.

WHOIS lookups were initially performed using command-line tools. Nowadays, many web-based tools exist, but command-line options often give us the most control over our queries and help filter and sort the resultant output. [Sysinternals WHOIS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/sysinternals/downloads/whois) for Windows or Linux [WHOIS](https://linux.die.net/man/1/whois) command-line utility are our preferred tools for gathering information. However, there are some online versions like [whois.domaintools.com](https://whois.domaintools.com/) we can also use.

We would get the following response from the previous command to run a `whois` lookup against the `facebook.com` domain. An example of this `whois` command is:

WHOIS

```shell
6165@htb[/htb]$ export TARGET="facebook.com" # Assign our target to an environment variable
6165@htb[/htb]$ whois $TARGET

We can gather the same data using `whois.exe` from Windows Sysinternals:

WHOIS

```cmd
C:\htb> whois.exe facebook.com
