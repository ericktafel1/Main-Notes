**Note:** The VM provided in the `OpenVAS Skills Assessment` section has OpenVAS pre-installed and the targets running. You can go to that section and start the VM and use OpenVAS throughout the module, which can be accessed at `https://< IP >:8080`. The OpenVAS credentials are: `htb-student`:`HTB_@cademy_student!`. You may also use these credentials to SSH into the target VM to configure OpenVAS.
