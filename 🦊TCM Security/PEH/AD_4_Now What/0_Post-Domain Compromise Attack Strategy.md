#NTDS   
# We Own the Domain Now What?  

Provide as much value to the client as possible

- Put your blinders on and do it again (identify more attack vectors to DA)
- Dump the NTDS.dit and crack passwords
- Eumerate shares for sensitive information

  

Permissions can be important

- What happens if our DA access is lost?
- Creating a DA account can be useful (DO NOT FORGET TO DELETE IT!)
- Creating a Golden Ticket can be useful too
