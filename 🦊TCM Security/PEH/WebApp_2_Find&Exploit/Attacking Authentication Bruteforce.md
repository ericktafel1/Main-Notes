## What is it?

Password-based authentication generally allows to register an account and set a password, or sometimes an account will be assigned to them by an administrator. Password-based authentication tends to be suseptible to brute-force attacks, account lockouts and credential stuffing attacks.

**A simple example**
-   A vulnerable web application allows users to sign up and set a password.
-   After 10 failed login attempts, an account is locked.
-   If an attacker uses 9 common passwords against many user accounts, they will gain access to ones that chose weak or common passwords.

Broken authentication can often lead to:
-   Account takeover
-   Sensitive data exposure

### Burpsuite Method
- Burpsuite > Send to Intruder > Sniper, add payload marker to password, Payload settings load /usr/share/seclists/SecListsMaster/Passwords/ >Start Attack
	- Look for length changes in results

### FFUF Method
- Save GET request from Burpsuite to .txt
	- change password value to `FUZZ`
```
ffuf -request req.txt -request-proto http -w /usr/share/seclist/SecLists-Master/Passwords/xato-net-10-million-passwords-10000.txt -fs 1814
```
- this command sends the GET request, fuzzing the password field with the specified wordlist, using protocol http and filter file size for sizes other than 1814.
