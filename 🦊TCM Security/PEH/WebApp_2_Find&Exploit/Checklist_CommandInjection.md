#CommandInjection

- [ ] Determine the technology stack: Which operating system and server software are in use?
- [ ] Identify potential injection points: URL parameters, form fields, HTTP headers, etc.
- [ ] Test for simple injections with special characters like ;, &&, ||, and |. Test for injection within command arguments.
- [ ] Test for blind command injection, where output is not returned in the response. If output isn't directly visible, try creating outbound requests (e.g. using ping or curl).
- [ ] Try to escape from any restriction mechanisms, like quotes or double quotes.
- [ ] Test with a list of potentially dangerous functions/methods (like exec(), system(), passthru() in PHP, or exec, eval in Node.js).
- [ ] Test for command injection using time delays (ping -c localhost).
- [ ] Test for command injection using &&, ||, and ;.
- [ ] Test with common command injection payloads, such as those from PayloadsAllTheThings.
- [ ] If there's a filter in place, try to bypass it using various techniques like encoding, command splitting, etc.
