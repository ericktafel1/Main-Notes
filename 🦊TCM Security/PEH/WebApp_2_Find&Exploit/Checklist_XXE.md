#XXE 
**Objective**
- [ ]   Identify endpoints that can process XML
- [ ]   Create a working XML payload that can be adapted to deliver exploits
- [ ]   Test identified endpoints for XXE

**Attack surface discovery**
- [ ]   Identify endpoints that accept XML payloads
    - [ ]   Review requests in proxy for XML data
    - [ ]   Identify endpoints that accept JSON by sending XML
    - [ ]   Identify endpoints that accept images by sending SVG images
    - [ ]   Identify endpoints that accept documents by sending DOCX or PDF files
- [ ]   Test with the header `Content-Type: application/xml`
- [ ]   Verify working XML payloads that can be adapted to deliver exploits
- [ ] Locate internal DTDs

**Testing**
- [ ]   Test for external entities with a simple non-malicious payload
- [ ]   Test for external entities with an available file (e.g. for Linux /etc/passwd)
- [ ]   Test for external entities with an available endpoint you control (e.g. collaborator or webhook.site)
- [ ]   Test for external entities with other available endpoints
    - [ ]   EC2 metadata endpoint `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data`
- [ ]   Test filters and restrictions
    - [ ]   Trigger error messages to exfiltrate information
- [ ]   Test for denial of service
- [ ] Test for code execution

**Impact**
- [ ]   Can we read sensitive files?
	- [ ] Config files
	- [ ] Sys files
	- [ ] SQLite files
	- [ ] SSH keys
- [ ]   Can we exfiltrate sensitive information?
- [ ]   Can we achieve code execution?
