This [room](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/windowsprivescarena) will teach you a variety of Windows privilege escalation tactics, including kernel exploits, DLL hijacking, service exploits, registry exploits, and more. This lab was built utilizing Sagi Shahar's privesc workshop (https://github.com/sagishahar/lpeworkshop) and utilized as part of The Cyber Mentor's Windows Privilege Escalation Udemy course (http://udemy.com/course/windows-privilege-escalation-for-beginners).

All tools needed to complete this course are on the **user** desktop (`C:\Users\user\Desktop\Tools`).

Let's first connect to the machine.  RDP is open on port 3389.  Your credentials are:

**username**: `user`
**password**: `password321`

For any administrative actions you might take, your credentials are:

**username**: `TCM`
**password**: `Hacker123`

*Note: We can access machines using `openvpn`, but Tryhackme will say we are not connected. Also,`xfreerdp` did not work but `rdesktop` does.*
